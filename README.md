Repository to host code relating to my work with the [Women's Brick Initiative](https://womensbrickinitiative.com/) Summer 2022

The Women's Brick Initiative Advocates for diversity, equity, and inclusion within LEGO products. My work as an intern in summer 2022 included conducting research on various aspects of diversity and representation in LEGO products, especially [minifigures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_minifigure), and writing blog posts to share our findings that will soon be posted on the WBI [website](https://womensbrickinitiative.com/). This work will also be shared with the broader LEGO community and with representatives from The LEGO Group in order to highlight opportunities for improvement and advocate for broader representation. 

This repository contains all of the data used in our analyses as well as the R code used to wrangle and visualize the data. There are several different sub-projects within this repository, which I will outline below.

## Projects

### Analysis of Gender and Flesh Tone Equity in LUGBULK parts

LUGBULK is a system through which Recognized Lego Communities (commonly known as LUGS), which are groups of LEGO fans who generally assemble in the same geographic region, have the opportunity to purchase LEGO parts in bulk yearly. Because the parts are purchased in bulk, they are less expensive than they would be to purchase individually. Many of the parts available are minifigure parts, including hair, heads, torsos, legs, and accessories.

Since WBI is a Recognized LEGO Community, we had access to information about all of the available parts for each year from 2015-2022. The data for this project is not included in the repository, as it is not publicly available. 

This project has two parts:

- Is LEGO Putting a Price on Diversity? An exploration of LUGBULK, where cheap LEGOs are bought in bulk (Part 1: Minifig Heads)

We conducted an analysis on gender equity and flesh tone diversity in minifig heads available and how this has changed over time from 2015-2022. We found that flesh tone diversity has improved somewhat but not much, yet gender diversity has improved significantly such that the percentages of male, female, and neutral heads are almost exactly equal in 2022. 

- Is LEGO Putting a Price on Diversity? An exploration of LUGBULK, where cheap LEGOs are bought in bulk (Part 2: Minifig Wigs)

We conducted an analysis comparing the number of female wigs to the number of male wigs available as well as comparing the price distributions for female versus male wigs in 2022. We found that the number of wigs was fairly gender-equitable, yet female wigs were surprisingly more expensive than male wigs.
